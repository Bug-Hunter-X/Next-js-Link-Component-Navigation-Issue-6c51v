# Next.js Link Component Navigation Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the Next.js `Link` component: unexpected behavior during navigation.  The provided example showcases a simple `Link` component that, despite appearing to be correctly configured, may fail to navigate as expected. This issue often arises from improper usage of the `href` prop or interference from other parts of the application.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Click the 'Go to Profile' link.  Observe whether navigation to the '/profile' page works correctly.

## Solution

The solution involves verifying that the `href` prop is correctly set and that no conflicting routing or JavaScript interferes with the Link component's behavior. The correct usage of the `Link` component is demonstrated in the `bugSolution.js` file.
